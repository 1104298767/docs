            This software is based on a free and open source project, <strong>Handsontable</strong>, which is a composite spreadsheet
            component for apps and websites. It is written in JavaScript and
            not constrained by any external framework. It can be easily modified or extended with custom plugins. It
            also binds to any source using the JSON format and handles large amounts of data. You can easily do all
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a> operations and
            provide end-users with an Excel-like experience.

        <h3>Basic concepts</h3>
        <p>
            Handsontable introduces a new approach to building spreadsheets for web projects.
            Typically, libraries like this give you all the features in one, pre-built package.
            It is not very effective as spreadsheets are usually very complex and heavy tools, so if you need
            just a single feature you end up with overhead code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Handsontable is different as it allows you to exclude all the unnecessary plugins from the package.
            It's created with modularity in mind and most plugins are developed upon the lightweight core. Not all
            the features have been moved from the core to plugins yet, but we're nearly there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concepts or technologies at the heart of Handsontable:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extensibility</strong> - it makes possible to build new functionalities upon the core and use
                    only those required in a certain project. It gives you the real freedom of creating.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)</strong> - in the future the most important parts of the library will be rewritten
                    to ES6 provide a better control over the code.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Virtual rendering</strong> - also known as "lazy loading". In short, we don't render the cells outside
                    the viewport until you scroll down or across the table to see them. This allows to handle large
                    datasets, some of which contain thousands of rows.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Getting help</h3>
        <p>
            In general, using Handsontable doesn't require high programming skills. However, if you need any
            custom modifications and have just started with JavaScript you may need some assistance from a
            more experienced developer.
